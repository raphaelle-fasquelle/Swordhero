Welcome to Madbox's Senior Dev Test :)

You are to develop a system for a 3d character (the hero) in an RPG game.
The test is divided into phases. The first Phase is mandatory and not completing it means the test was failed. We expect the first phase to be completed within 8 hours of work.
We also added 4 Bonus Phases. These are optional and you are free to choose to develop them if you wish, in any order.
We will evaluate code architecture, code readability, code performance, and game feel. 

Phase 1: Mandatory: 
    - Implement character movement in the 3d environment using 1 finger / Mouse left click + drag.
        - Reference: Archero
    - Hero will auto-attack when not moving
    - Hero auto-selects the closest target in range and sticks to it until the target is dead or the hero moves.
    - Hero can equip 3 different weapons: curved sword, greatsword, long sword
    - When equipped, each weapon will modify:
        - Attack animation speed 
        - Timing to apply damage to fit the animation
        - Hero's movement speed
        - Attack range
    - Hero starts the game with a random weapon equipped automatically.
    - Enemies spawn in random positions on the map and stay there waiting to be attacked.

Bonus Phase: The UI
    - Enemies have health bars
    - Each attack displays the damage done to the target

Bonus Phase: Weapon drop
    - Weapons drop from enemies when killed
    - Hero collect and equip weapons by walking over them
    - Equipped weapon is displayed in the HUD

Bonus Phase: Better enemies
    - Enemies have some AI that gives life to the enemies.
    - Each enemy killed grants points that are saved in the player's profile.
    - Enemies get stronger with each enemy kill
    - Player takes damage and the game ends when the player dies.
    - Hero's health bar is displayed in the HUD
        
Bonus Phase: Polishing
    - The game has a start menu and end game screen.
    - Weapon hits have visual effects
    - Music and sound

We included in the project:
	- Assets for the hero
	- Assets for the enemy
	- Assets for the weapons
	- A combat scene with a basic setup for lights, camera, and floor
	- A scene dedicated to the UI with basic 1 finger joystick graphics.
	- Addressables package is included
	- TextMeshPro Essentials
	- Unity Project is set up in a basic way using URP with Unity 2020.3.0f1

When you are done, please send us your source code (via GitHub or any other online repository) so that we can make a code review.
Please also attach a README.md document in which you'll mention
    - The time it took you to perform the exercise
    - The parts that were difficult for you and why
    - The parts you think you could do better and how
    - What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
    - Any comment you may have
